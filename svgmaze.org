* Notes

This is a simple maze generator that outputs the result to a static SVG
image. It uses a recursive random walk method as a quick to implement
algorithm. This means it's prone to stack overflow if a large maze is
requested (>300x300).

The SVG output is a series of horizontal and vertical lines reduced to only
those cases where line length covers 1 or more cells to reduce line count.

* Tasks

* Issues

** TODO Revisit the `maze_visit` function and rewrite to avoid recursion depth.

Source: [file:src/main.c::maze_visit]

Rewrite as an iterative procedure, or limit recursion depth as another
potential base case. Ensure that all cells still get visited.
